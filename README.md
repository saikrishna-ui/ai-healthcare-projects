# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
This project uses a real medical dataset to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on health indicators like glucose, BMI, insulin levels, age, etc. It applies logistic regression (a classification ML algorithm) to make predictions and evaluate model accuracy.

## ðŸ§  Techniques Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Logistic Regression (from sklearn)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Correlation heatmaps

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, etc.
- Label: Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

## ðŸ§ª Model Performance
- Accuracy: 75%
- Precision (Class 1): 67%
- Recall (Class 1): 62%

## ðŸ’¾ Output
- Trained model saved as `diabetes_model.pkl`
